UNDERSTANDING YOUR AUTHORITY

The authority of purpose or the ability of purpose.

The using of your gifts and skills to achieve things in your purpose is  the authority of your purpose.

(This involves the acquisition of each skill set needed for the operation of your gifts.)

'It is important to understand this two factors your tools and your place.'

PLACE:
You understand why the place is important. Your purpose and the place co-exists. Meaning, it is the place that makes your purpose possible. It is platform that facilitates development and implementation of your purpose. And the Place requires your contribution through purpose to serve and maintain the place. 

TOOLS:
  

THE MAKE UP OF YOUR PURPOSE:
