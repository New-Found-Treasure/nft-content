## Introduction

## Background (Etymology) of Anoint:

Let's take a journey together in the world of the scriptures and explore the concept of "Anoint". A word search show that the word Anoint (Anointing, Anointed) appears 126 times in the Old Testament and 19 times in the New Testament. Anoint is translated from a Hebrew word "Maw-shakh"in the Old Testament" and the greek word "Chrio" in the New Testament.

## Definition of Anoint:

Anoint is:

_"To smear or rub with or oil as a process of setting a thing apart for a specific purpose of office"_

- If holy is being being set apart for a purpose. Them to anoint is setting up that purpose.
- Holy and anointing are like hand and glove
- The two are the purview of the Master to serve his will.

This is making appointment orders for person to service in specific place or office. The gifts a person are appointed to operate in that specific function. The anointing does for that.

- It was meant for tabernacle or temple duties to make things.
- It is made to give purpose to things. Once done that thing can produce fruitfully in that purpose.
- The work of purpose is the purview of the master. And it is found in Christ or the pattern the tabernacle. It makes rich.
- So I infer that such to have that power is something sort after. And the buying and selling of such power is needed in the world.
- This can be used to create all sorts of things.
- So the angle of the anointing is turning purpose for self-service issues or turning purpose to service the Master's will.
- Cause whomever has this power it will surely produce.
- the commerce of the ingredients in the anointing oil is representative of how the power to give purpose is something that is highly sought after in the world. And so called benefactor of purpose is paid huge sums of money for it.
