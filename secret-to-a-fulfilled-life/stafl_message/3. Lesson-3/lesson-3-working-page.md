$$HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR RELATIONSHIP$$


When you know what your relationship with anyone is based on then you know what expect and what not expect from somebody.

You will know what the person is capable or not capable of


Not defining any one of your relationships and relying on what you expect or view things is navie.te. The world will eat you and swallow whole with such kind of approach.

There are following circles of relationship:

+ Relationship Circle of Yourself 

+ Relationship Circle of with other people 

+ Relationship Circle of Yourself 
This one is important relationship causing it is the root of how you determine just about all other relationship.

You need to define your point of reference for making choices.  There is your judgement made up of your opinions. And then there is the truth made up of all the actual facts of the referenced circumstance. 

You can choose to your opinion as the source of truth to power your choices. Or you can lift up the truth to power your choices. If you chose the truth you will have a balance reference for making choices. But if you chose your opinion all choices you will be informed by your own truth. And will be unbalanced. 

Now take you don't this exercise which relationship do have in the circle of yourself! Is your truth or the truth that guides your choices and actions. 

Sometimes the people might get the wrong idea. Thinking that they need to destroy self. That's not possible to start with. Rather there must balance between Truth, Self, choices. 

This where self recognises that truth is main point of reference. So you are allowed to come with your opinion. And I encourage you to do that. But there needs to be a conference each time where your opinion is compared with the truth. When it is incompatible then it is dropped and the truth upheld. And choices made based on the truth. This is the way. The head is the truth and your opinion submissive to the truth. 

This is will also help you self correct, have accountability, remain teachable, and highly adaptable.

+ Relationship with others

Relationship fall into such categories:

- Union by dependencies
- Union of friendship

+ Union by Dependencies

--In here you find a relationship defined by offence:

These are your if your enemy is my enemy then we are friends kind of relationship. Where people have build a relationship based on a shared value of hatred or offence towards something.

So look here I have not described relationship based on ties such as family, romantic etc. Because relationship are based on a shared value. That's the currency of exchange for relationship. Not we are family so I expect my father, or mother, brother or sister to have such values as described by your own truth not the actual truth. 

How would you expect to person in such a relationship to be a ride and die friend? People have been disappointed cause of not defining their relationship by on the truth.  

--Relationship based on using someone or depending on somebody for things:

These this one of the most common kind of union setup. 


THE MANIPULATION AND DOMINATION RELATIONSHIP
This is based on manipulation. This is the Needy to Needy arrangement. It can either be the needy person offering something to the other people in exchange for pleasure of companionship. This would find in love relationships. Where convenience brings two people based on a perceived needy. 

Here the manipulator is the one who seeks to use someone to amass things they need. The manipulator is the receiver. And they are not the begging type. They use powerplay to violate the provider into giving them what they want. They make a provider think he is the needy. That is why I call it a Needy to Needy arrangement. 

So in such a relationship the true value of love and happiness is provision and submission to domination. The is the weaker person dominating the stronger person.

When let's say you wake up and see it for what it is. The manipulator will attack the victim by character assassination to destroy the victims honor.


THE SLAVER AND SLAVE RELATIONSHIP

The other is a "Rescuer arrangement". This is a the slave master and slave arrangement. This where a person eats another person's virtue to power their needs and dreams. 

The slave master is the a person unwilling to fend for them self so there seek out a rescuer. The slave is the person who works to give sustenance to the needy. 

In such arrangement the provider has a mania issue. They need dependants to shore up there self image of power. While the receiver is using the providers virtue to sustain them.

If you don't identify this type of arrangement. You might get into a relationship with someone cause you were like you neef help cause you in a crisis. And you're thinking they can help you get back on your feet again. But the moment your slave realise you want to be independent they don't want to help you get independent. They can help you when they feel you are dependent on them. Not for to fly free.

This is a crazy arrangement cause the true victim is the provider. They are wasting their virtue on things not related to their destiny. While the reciever have bequeathed their potential to create dreams that would have benefitted the world. 


+ B1UILDERS ARRANGEMENT

This is union of friendship. This is where both parties are dedicated to building each other. 

This is a relationship where this a lover and the beloved. Where the object of affection is the loved thing not love of self, manipulation. Where the lover is willing to do all that is possible to have the beloved provided.

This where the beloved is equally willing to make that the love is loved. And all the love wants to met our of the Union of obedience towards each other. There value is ultimate sacrifice towards the others needs. Where all needs are met in each through each other.

So this is what you ought to do. 

So like a marriage it is meant to be an incubator of dream not a death bed of dreams. Where only one person dreams are met. And the other person's dreams and destiny dies. Here life gives life to all things.

So the idea is how can I help somebody grow. What can I do to help somebody. Identify somebody's pain points and find a solution for it  What can I do to further anothers dreams. Not quench the light. 

This is a foundation for anything that is true. Great business lead with this. True worthy and greatness reading in building others.
