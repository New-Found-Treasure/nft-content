# Lesson 1: What Is True Purpose?

Using of your gifts to serve according to the intended is you _"True Purpose"_

Very person enters this world with a purpose. It motivates the aims of your life. Purpose guides life's decisions, influences behavior, shapes goals, offers a sense of direction, and creates meaning. Your purpose is made up of your gifts and how they function to serve in the home, in your community and in the kingdom of our Father. For example, when Jesus the Master chose the fishermen: Peter, John, James, and Andrew, appointed them as Apostles, and called them as Fishers of men.\` It was in line with the same gifts they used at home, in their community(at home), and were now to be used in the Master's service.

This is the harmony of true purpose. It works on three levels. And will get back to the three level in a bit. For now know that at all levels _"You are made to Serve"_. 

We are like the various parts of a human body. Each part gets its meaning from the body as a whole, not the other way around. The body we're talking about is Christ's body of chosen people. Each of us finds our meaning and function as a part of his body. But as a chopped-off finger or cut-off toe we wouldn't amount to much. So since we find ourselves fashioned into all these excellently formed and marvelously functioning parts in Christ's body, let's just go ahead and be what we were made to be, without enviously or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other, or trying to be something we aren't.!

Some people feel hesitant about pursuing their life purpose because they worry that it sounds like a self-serving or selfish quest. However, true purpose is about recognizing your own gifts and using them to contribute to the worldâ€”whether those gifts are playing beautiful music for others to enjoy, helping friends solve problems, or simply bringing more joy into the lives of those around you.
