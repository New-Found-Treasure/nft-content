# Concept of Holy And Purpose

## Definition of Holy:
Today I would like you to put on your thinking caps. Let's take a journey together and explore the concept of being holy. Let's start with the scriptures because that is we will find this concept. Holy is translated from the old testament hebrew word "Ko'desh". It properly means, to be separated from the rest and adjoined to something for a special function.

Set apart from the rest for a special function]

I understand that the first thing you would to your mind is 'being holy' is being ceremonially or morally clean. And yes that is true. However, this cleanliness is in the context of the root of the meaning for being holy, which has to do with the purpose a thing is set part. 

So what would make something unclean is a thing doing something that is not its purpose. 
So also corruption should be seen in the context of dedicated purpose. So that to be corrupted is the condition or affinity to go off purpose and participate in an sanctioned purpose.
