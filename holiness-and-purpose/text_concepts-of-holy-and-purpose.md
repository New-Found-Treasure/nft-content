# Concept of Holy And Purpose

## Definition of Holy:

Today I would like you to put on your thinking caps. Let's take a journey together and explore the concept of being holy. Let's start with the scriptures because that is where we find this concept. Holy is translated from the old testament hebrew word "Ko'desh". It properly means, to be separated from the rest and adjoined to something for a special function.

## Scratching The Surface of Holy

Generally 'holy' is hugely associated with being ceremonially or morally clean. And yes that is quite correct. However, this  
being ceremonially or morally clean must be seen in the context of the root meaning of the word "holy". And you know what that is? Yes you guessed it right. It is being "Set apart from the rest for a special function". The context of Holy is tied to the function or purpose of a thing. What makes something holy is its adherence to and application of its function or purpose.

Therefore in this sense, something becomes unclean, or ruined if it is diverted and applied for a different purpose than what it was meant for. "Now does that begin to makes sense?" So to be holy or clean is an indicator that a thing is working as intended. While unholiness or uncleanliness is an indicator that a thing is not working according to the intended purpose. And by extension the concept of being in sin or sinful, in this context of holiness I must add, would be when something does not meet the standard required to be chosen for a particular purpose. So to be in sin is like "buddy sorry ouch! you just don't quite cut it for this role. Sorry off you go with the trash."

So in turn we can also look at the concept of "Corruption" in the contextual meaning of Holy. Then "Corruption" would be  
the process by which a function is changed from its original state through erroneous or debased, or abusive application.

Someone is holy if one is operating according to one's intended function. What is done outside must march what is in the heart. The walk and talk must be in harmony otherwise it is like what Prophet Isaiah said,"These people draw near to Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. Their worship of Me is but rules taught by men." (Isaiah 29:13)

## Deep Dive in Purpose

Very person enters this world with a purpose. It motivates the aims of your life. Purpose guides life's decisions, influences behavior, shapes goals, offers a sense of direction, and creates meaning. Your purpose is made up of your gifts and how they function to serve in the home, in your community and in the kingdom of our Father. For example, when Jesus the Master chose the fishermen: Peter, John, James, and Andrew, appointed them as Apostles, and called them as Fishers of men. It was in line with the same gifts they used at home, in their community, and were now used in the Master's service. 


**There is a harmony to everyone's purpose**. It answers the three essential qualities that make life worth living: 
1. Faith
2. Hope and 
3. Love

1. **Faith answers the questions**: _"Why am I here and When do I feel fulfilled?"_ We want our lives to count for something! We want a significant and meaningful Life. It is speaks of relationship. It is at the home or our heart where our faith resides. Just as we have a family. We are to have a relationship with our Father. 
2. **Hope answers the questions**: _Where do I belong? And Where Am I Going?_ We want to know that our lives are safe and our futures secure. A hope that ensures the future. We find that the work we do in our community brings us a sense of belonging and a confident direction in life.
3. **Love answers the question**: _Who am I?_ We want to be valued as persons and to be accepted as we are. It is in the service of our Master where value and self-worth is found. We are called as children of God.


Your purpose is unique to you, "and what you identify as your path will be different from others." "Whatâ€™s more, your purpose can actually shift and change throughout life in response to the evolving priorities and fluctuations of your own experiences." Problems start when self begins to dominate to the place of selfless service. In all the aspects your purpose you will notice that your gifts are serve selflessly. And you find fulfillment in the act of selfless service. This is true even in your relationship with the Father. Your purpose is meant for service not for self serving motivations.

## Pitfalls To Avoid
The thinking that self serving holiness We must misinterpret yourselves as people who are bringing this goodness to God. No, God brings it all to you. The only accurate way to understand ourselves is by what God is and by what he does for us, not by what we are and what we do for him. In this way we are like the various parts of a human body. Each part gets its meaning from the body as a whole, not the other way around. The body we're talking about is Christ's body of chosen people. Each of us finds our meaning and function as a part of his body. But as a chopped-off finger or cut-off toe we wouldn't amount to much, would we? So since we find ourselves fashioned into all these excellently formed and marvelously functioning parts in Christ's body, let's just go ahead and be what we were made to be, without enviously or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other, or trying to be something we aren't.



look at Paul in Romans talking about each one of us knowing level of faith (Romans 12:4-8)

The jesus on for this purpose I came into the world to save the lost (Luke 19:10; John 6:38)
