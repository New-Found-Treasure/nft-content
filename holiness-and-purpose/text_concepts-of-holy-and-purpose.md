# Concept of Holy And Purpose

## Definition of Holy:
Today I would like you to put on your thinking caps. Let's take a journey together and explore the concept of being holy. Let's start with the scriptures because that is we will find this concept. Holy is translated from the old testament hebrew word "Ko'desh". It properly means, to be separated from the rest and adjoined to something for a special function.

# Scratching The Surface of Holy 
Generally 'holy' is hugely associated with being ceremonially or morally clean. And yes that is quite correct. However, this 
being ceremonially or morally clean is seen in the context of the root meaning of the word "holy". And you know what that is? Yes you guessed it right. It is "Set apart from the rest for a special function or purpose". The meaning of Holy is tied to function or purpose of a thing. What makes something holy is it adherence its function and the working of that purpose.

Therefore in this sense, something becomes unclean, or ruined if it is diverted and applied for a different purpose than what it was meant for. "Now does that begin to makes sense?" So to be holy or clean is an indicator that a holy thing is working as intended. While uncleanliness or unholy is an indicator a thing is not working according to the intended purpose. And by extension the concept of being in sin or sinful in this context would be when something does not meet the standard required for that particular purpose. So to be in sin is like "buddy sorry ouch! you just don't quite cut it for this role. So Mr. Garbage man throw that in the trash." 


cleanliness is in the context of the root of the meaning for being holy, which has to do with the purpose a thing is set part. 

So what would make something unclean is a thing doing something that is not its purpose. 
So also corruption should be seen in the context of dedicated purpose. So that to be corrupted is the condition or affinity to go off purpose and participate in an sanctioned purpose.
