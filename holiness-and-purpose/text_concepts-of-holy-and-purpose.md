# Concept of Holy And Purpose

## Definition of Holy:
Today I would like you to put on your thinking caps. Let's take a journey together and explore the concept of being holy. Let's start with the scriptures because that is where we find this concept. Holy is translated from the old testament hebrew word "Ko'desh". It properly means, to be separated from the rest and adjoined to something for a special function.

Set apart from the rest for a special function]

# Scratching The Surface of Holy 
Generally 'holy' is hugely associated with being ceremonially or morally clean. And yes that is quite correct. However, this 
being ceremonially or morally clean must be seen in the context of the root meaning of the word "holy". And you know what that is? Yes you guessed it right. It is "Set apart from the rest for a special function". The context of Holy is tied to function or purpose of a thing. What makes something holy is its adherence and application of the function or purpose.

Therefore in this sense, something becomes unclean, or ruined if it is diverted and applied for a different purpose than what it was meant for. "Now does that begin to makes sense?" So to be holy or clean is an indicator that a thing is working as intended. While  unholiness or uncleanliness is an indicator that a thing is not working according to the intended purpose. And by extension the concept of being in sin or sinful, in this context of holiness I must add, would be when something does not meet the standard required to be chosen for a particular purpose. So to be in sin is like "buddy sorry ouch! you just don't quite cut it for this role. Sorry off you go with the trash." 
 
So in turn we can also look at the concept of "Corruption" in the context meaning of Holy. TThen "Corruption" would be 
the process by which a function is changed from its original state through erroneous or debased, or abusive application. So associating holiness only to a perceived show of moral virtue when in actual sense you have abandoned your function, or your are abusing your function is in error. Someone is holy if one is operating according to one's intend function. So instead of saying I'm holy say this is my function and I'm walking in it.
