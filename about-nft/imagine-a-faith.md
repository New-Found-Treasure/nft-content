# Imagine A Faith

For so long now we have been afraid to find out for ourselves who this Jesus is to us. Afraid of taking the initiative to gain understanding and acquire knowledge of the personal relationship one can have with Jesus.

Afraid to carry out our own research we need to form the knowledge base that informs and guides our practice of this faith in Jesus The Chosen One.

From the time of our forefathers up to now we had relinquished this right to learn for ourselves. We resigned ourselves to live based on a faith derived from other people's revelations, experiences and practices. A borrowed faith, mixed with human traditions, prejudices and stereotypes.

So instead of inheriting a faith that brings peace and harmony. Because that is what the gospel of Jesus Christ does, it heals the people and it heals the land. But instead, we have no fulfilment and there is an erosion that not only eats at our faith but also eats at the fabric of our society. Is all lost as some have been saying that we are a doomed people. No we are not doomed. We have a message for you.

"God has concealed his ways from those who think themselves wise, and know-it-alls, but has revealed, and spelled them out clearly to us ordinary people." God delights in concealing things; and it is the delight of an expert authority in discovering things."

The revelation of Master Jesus the Chosen One is not given to a selected few but to all who choose to pursuit it and uncover it. This is New Found Treasure Church Online, uncovering the Mystery of Master Jesus, the Chosen One.

Now, imagine a faith that is not afraid. A faith that is not ashamed. Imagine a faith that has real liberty. Imagine a faith that makes you have real life experiences.
